My learning was focused on clean HTML code paired with CSS and Javascript.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project I will add an option to seamlessly move between sections.

## Lessons Learned:

Separations of concern. Starting simple in HTML. Using HTML to build up the CSS, and then Javascript for behavorability. How Javascript and jQuery work together. 

Importance on using PHP, Javascript or a form builder for forms.
